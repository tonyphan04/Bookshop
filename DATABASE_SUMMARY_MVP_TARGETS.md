## 🎯 **MVP Target Achievement**

### **✅ What We Accomplished**

#### **1. Simplified Schema Design**

- **Removed**: 8+ non-MVP tables (Publisher, Language, Review, Category, Customer, Admin, StockMovement, Supplier)
- **Kept**: 7 core MVP tables only
- **Result**: Clean, focused database that supports essential bookstore operations

#### **2. Unified User Management**

```csharp
public enum UserRole { Customer = 1, Admin = 2 }
public class User {
    // Single table for both customers and admins
    public UserRole Role { get; set; }
}
```

#### **3. Professional Cart-to-Order Flow**

```csharp
// Temporary shopping cart
CartItem → [Checkout] → OrderItem (permanent)
                    → [Clear cart]
```

#### **4. Price Integrity**

- **CartItems**: Use current book prices
- **OrderItems**: Capture price at time of purchase
- **Orders**: Store final total for financial records

#### **5. Data Relationships**

```
User (1) → (M) CartItems    [Shopping cart]
User (1) → (M) Orders       [Order history]
Order (1) → (M) OrderItems  [Order details]
Book (1) → (M) CartItems    [Current shopping]
Book (1) → (M) OrderItems   [Purchase history]
Genre (1) → (M) Books       [Categorization]
Author (M) ↔ (M) Books      [Authorship via AuthorBooks]
```
